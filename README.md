# This is my second Core Data app.

## The objectives for this app are:
1) Understand the subclassing of NSManagedObject to make my own classes for each data entity to create 1 to 1 mapping between entities and classes in code.
2) Learn about the data types available in Core Data entities including a few outside the usual string and number types.
3) Learn about validating data to automatically check values before saving.
